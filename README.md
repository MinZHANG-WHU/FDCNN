# FDCNN

This repository contains code, network definitions and pre-trained models for change detection on remote sensing images using deep learning.

The implementation uses the [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) framework.

## Motivation


In this work, we use scene-level samples (from the AID data set) of remote sensing scene classification, which are easier to obtain than pixel-level samples, for learning deep features from different remote sensing scenes at different scales. These features learned from specific scenes (cultivated land, lakes, vegetation, etc.) are more affected. The changes in these scenes are usually more important. Based on this idea, A new CNN structure and training strategies are proposed for remote sensing image change detection, which is supervised but requires very few pixel-level training samples. Advantageously, it has good generalization ability and multi-scale change detection capabilities.


## Content

###  Networks

We provide a deep neural network based on the [VGG16 architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556). It was trained on the AID dataset to learn the multi-scale deep features from remote sensing images. The pre-trained weights can be download from the [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mAH0Hj9qi2M4GzVaNKe9xJkyeYMf2TLO).

We proposed a novel FDCNN to produce change detection maps from high-resolution RS images. It is suitable for **multi-scale** remote sensing image change detection tasks.

### How to start

1. Install Caffe with Python 2.7

	1. Follow the instructions in [Installation](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html), note the version of Python. Or using our [pre-build runtime](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OLIgpx0Jy6LT0KCkgYLcb0d3FvAJXEA0) (with CUDA 8.0 and for Windows only).
	2. Please add the absolute path of folder "caffe_layers" to the PYTHONPATH so that PyCaffe can search for the layer implementation file.

2. Training VGG16 & FDCNN

    1. Training VGG16 using the AID dataset.
   
    2. Training FDCNN using the WV2 site 1 dataset.


3. Testing FDCNN

    1. Download the test data sets and unzip them to the "datasets"  subfolder.
    
    2. Use your own trained FDCNN model, or download our [pre-trained FDCNN model](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v1Q9gOqgzk657aaPWfEirSR-aJafF7BS).
    
    3. Evaluation
    
        - To test the accuracy of FDCNN on the test datasets, run the following commands:
            ```
            python exp_test_custom.py \
                --sensor=ZY3 \
                --alpha=2.0
            ```

        - To test the accuracy of FDCNN on the SZTAKI datasets, run the following commands:
